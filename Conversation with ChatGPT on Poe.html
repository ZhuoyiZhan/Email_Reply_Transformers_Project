This is a short list of frequently-asked questions and answers on the website for the Vanderbilt University Data Science Institute's page on the Data Science undergraduate minor:</p>
<p>Question: I am a rising senior or current senior and cannot register for DS 1000. Why?<br>
<!-- -->Answer: Rising seniors and current seniors can only register for DS 1000 if there are available seats immediately before the semester begins with permission of the instructor. DS 1000 is intended as an introduction to data science for first years and sophomores, which is why this restriction is in place.</p>
<p>Question: How do I find courses approved for the data science minor on YES?<br>
<!-- -->Answer: On YES, to select all courses approved for credit in the Data Science minor offered in a given semester, select the “Advanced” link next to the search box, select the “Class Attributes” drop-down box on the bottom right of the advanced search page, and then select “Eligible for Data Science” to find all courses. (Note that these course tags will not all be in place on YES until the registration period for Fall 2021 begins.)</p>
<p>Question: What is the difference between CS 1100 and DS 1100?<br>
<!-- -->Answer: Nothing. They are the same course. They meet the same time in the same place and are taught by the same instructor. They are just cross-listed.</p></div></div></div><div class="Message_humanOptimisticFooter__zm1hu"></div><div class="Message_row___ur0Y"><div class="Message_botMessageBubble__CPGMI "><div class="Markdown_markdownContainer__UyYrv"><p>Thank you for providing the context.

I was hoping to take a DS elective class and was wondering if BSCI 3270 (Statistical Methods in Biology) or BSCI 3890 (Special Topics in Biological Sciences - Programming for Biologists) would count. Neither of them is specifically listed on the DS elective website but each has very close equivalents on the website. </p>
<p>Let me know if these classes count or if there is any more information I can provide.</p>

<p>The admin's repsonse:<br>
<!-- -->Hi FirstName,<br>
<!-- -->Thanks so much for reaching out, and this is a great question! BSCI 3270 already counts towards the DS Minor and can used to satisfy the statistics requirement. However, this does mean that it cannot be used as an elective. On the other hand, also BSCI 3890 (Special Topics in Biological Sciences – Programming for Biologists) may be an option. Since it is not already an approved elective, it must go through a review process which may not complete in time for registration. If you’d like for the DS Minor to review this course to be potentially added as an elective, please do so through our elective request form.</p>
<p>I hope this helps to answer your questions, and best of luck as you choose courses during registration!</p></div></div></div><div class="Message_humanOptimisticFooter__zm1hu"></div><div class="Message_row___ur0Y"><div class="Message_botMessageBubble__CPGMI "><div class="Markdown_markdownContainer__UyYrv"><p>Based on the sample email and response you provided, here is a draft response as an administrator at the Data Science Institute:</p>
<p>Dear FirstName,</p>
<p>Thank you for your email and for your interest in taking a DS elective class. BSCI 3270 (Statistical Methods in Biology) is already approved for the DS Minor and can be used to satisfy the statistics requirement. However, it cannot be used as an elective.</p>
<p>Regarding BSCI 3890 (Special Topics in Biological Sciences - Programming for Biologists), while it is not already an approved elective, it may be an option. However, it would need to go through a review process that may not complete in time for registration. If you would like for the DS Minor to review this course to be potentially added as an elective, please submit an elective request form through our website.</p>

<p>We can certainly update your record to reflect PSY-PC 2110 as fulfilling the statistics requirement for the DS Minor.

<!-- -->Hi! My name is FirstName LastName and I’m a sophomore in A&amp;S. With registration coming up, I was wondering if I were able to meet with anybody to discuss advising about my courses and finishing the minor. Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>The admin's response:<br>
<!-- -->A great way to assess this is to begin with a discussion with your academic advisor. Your academic advisor sees the full scope of your current progress in your academic program (your major(s) and/or other minor(s)) alongside any additional requirements depending on which school you’re in (e.g., A&amp;S vs Engineering).</p>
<p>We recommend doing some individual course planning by using the DS Minor requirements page (<a class="Markdown_linkPurpleBackground__dBoWD" href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/undergrad-datascience/minor/" node="[object Object]" target="_blank">https://www.vanderbilt.edu/undergrad-datascience/minor/</a>) alongside the Course Descriptions page (<a class="Markdown_linkPurpleBackground__dBoWD" href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/undergrad-datascience/course-descriptions/" node="[object Object]" target="_blank">https://www.vanderbilt.edu/undergrad-datascience/course-descriptions/</a>). Planning our your anticipated courses semester by semester usually provides solid insights into what may be possible within your undergraduate academic career. We’re happy to answer any specific questions about the minor. For example, we’re happy to address questions about course availability, revisions to degree audits, review of new electives, undergraduate research, and emergent unusual circumstances regarding the DS Minor.</p>
<p>I hope this was helpful, and keep in mind that we’ve crafted our website to empower students with as much information as possible to successfully incorporate the DS Minor into their degree programs. Give it a look, and I’m sure between you and your academic advisor, you’ll be able to plan out what can work!</p></div></div></div><div class="Message_humanOptimisticFooter__zm1hu"></div><div class="Message_row___ur0Y"><div class="Message_botMessageBubble__CPGMI "><div class="Markdown_markdownContainer__UyYrv"><p>Based on the example provided, here is a draft response as an administrator at the Data Science Institute:</p>

This is a short list of frequently-asked questions and answers on the website for the Vanderbilt University Data Science Institute's page on the Data Science undergraduate minor:\n\nQuestion: I am a rising senior or current senior and cannot register for DS 1000. Why?\nAnswer: Rising seniors and current seniors can only register for DS 1000 if there are available seats immediately before the semester begins with permission of the instructor. DS 1000 is intended as an introduction to data science for first years and sophomores, which is why this restriction is in place.\n\nQuestion: How do I find courses approved for the data science minor on YES?\nAnswer: On YES, to select all courses approved for credit in the Data Science minor offered in a given semester, select the “Advanced” link next to the search box, select the “Class Attributes” drop-down box on the bottom right of the advanced search page, and then select “Eligible for Data Science” to find all courses. (Note that these course tags will not all be in place on YES until the registration period for Fall 2021 begins.)\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between CS 1100 and DS 1100?\nAnswer: Nothing. They are the same course. They meet the same time in the same place and are taught by the same instructor. They are just cross-listed.","__isNode":"PoeMessageShare"},{"id":"UG9lTWVzc2FnZVNoYXJlOjkyMTQzMw==","didSkipContext":false,"author":"chinchilla","text":"Thank you for providing the context.

BSCI 3270 already counts towards the DS Minor and can used to satisfy the statistics requirement. However, this does mean that it cannot be used as an elective. On the other hand, also BSCI 3890 (Special Topics in Biological Sciences – Programming for Biologists) may be an option. Since it is not already an approved elective, it must go through a review process which may not complete in time for registration. If you’d like for the DS Minor to review this course to be potentially added as an elective, please do so through our elective request form. \n\nI hope this helps to answer your questions, and best of luck as you choose courses during registration!

Any help would be greatly appreciated! \n\nThe admin's response:\nA great way to assess this is to begin with a discussion with your academic advisor. Your academic advisor sees the full scope of your current progress in your academic program (your major(s) and/or other minor(s)) alongside any additional requirements depending on which school you’re in (e.g., A\u0026S vs Engineering). \n \nWe recommend doing some individual course planning by using the DS Minor requirements page (https://www.vanderbilt.edu/undergrad-datascience/minor/) alongside the Course Descriptions page (https://www.vanderbilt.edu/undergrad-datascience/course-descriptions/). Planning our your anticipated courses semester by semester usually provides solid insights into what may be possible within your undergraduate academic career. We’re happy to answer any specific questions about the minor. For example, we’re happy to address questions about course availability, revisions to degree audits, review of new electives, undergraduate research, and emergent unusual circumstances regarding the DS Minor. \n \nI hope this was helpful, and keep in mind that we’ve crafted our website to empower students with as much information as possible to successfully incorporate the DS Minor into their degree programs.
